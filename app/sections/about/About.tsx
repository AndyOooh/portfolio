          A Danish national relocated to buzzling <span>Bangkok</span> some years ago. I spend my days 
          in the 'big mango' with my <span>girlfriend</span>, playing football and building web things. 
          <br />
          <span>My interest</span> in web development began in <span>2020</span> when I couldn't
          find the tools I needed for my <span>crypto</span> projects. After playing around with
          different APIs in the backend, the frontend quickly caught my interest as well. <br />
          <br />
          <span>Fast-forward</span> to today, and Iâ€™ve completed dozens of courses, bootcamps, personal
          projects and a few collaborations.
