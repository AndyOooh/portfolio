          <span>Hello!</span> I'm Andreas, or <span>Andy</span> as the domain says. <br />
          <br />
          From Denmark but relocated to buzzling <span>Bangkok</span> some years ago, I now feel at
          home in the 'big mango' with my <span>girlfriend</span> and the international community
          I'm a part of. <br />
          <br />
          <span>My interest</span> in web development began in <span>2020</span> when I couldn't
          find the tools I needed for my <span>crypto</span> projects. After playing around with
          different APIs in the backend, the frontend quickly caught my interest as well. <br />{' '}
          <br />
          <span>Fast-forward</span> to today, and Iâ€™ve completed dozens of courses, personal
          projects and a few collaborations. My main focus these days is the <span>MERN</span> stack
          and <span>AWS</span>. <br />
